# Game-OrbitWars

I recently completed a project in Programming 12 at school that I'm quite proud of. It is a two-player versus game set in the orbit of Earth. The game features working gravity, pulling players toward Earth and the moving Moon. Players must manage their fuel carefully and utilize their complement of explosive and EMP torpedoes to force the other player into the Earth or Moon's gravity well.

Player 1 controls:
WASD to move
LSHIFT for explosive torpedo
LCTRL for EMP torpedo

Player 2 controls:
ARROW KEYS to move
RSHIFT for explosive torpedo
RCTRL for EMP torpedo

Be warned that newtonian physics are in effect - if you apply thrust in one direction, your player will not stop moving until you apply thrust in the opposite direction. Your first objective in the game should be to get to one of the yellow fuel depots, as moving around and firing torpedoes costs a lot of fuel.
